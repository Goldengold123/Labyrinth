Seven boys and seven girls, lined up under the hazy Cretan sun.\n\nWeaponless, defenseless. Which death for these youth would be worse; devoured by a half-man beast, or starved in a lightless corner?\n\nThe threads of fate were to run bare today, is what the others presumed. But you have a plan. The bloody tributes have continued for too long.\n\nA foolâ€™s plan, not untried before; yet even the bravest of warriors had failed. Will you be the one to complete it?\n\nYour tunic is heavy, the sheathed sword underneath warming uncomfortably in the heat. You shift it a bit to prevent the guards from noticing.\n\nThis beast, the Minotaur, how will it act? Will it be possible to speak reason with it? It is, after all, half man. You reprimand yourself with a pinch; be more concerned about how to survive the journey first.

And so it begins. The guards shove you forward. You shove yourself forward before your temper can strike out. Remember, weaponless, defenseless, a sacrifice to something higher. Sacrifices do not fight back.\n\nAlone, you are escorted to an entrance. You wonder if you will see the boy who was beside you again.\n\nThe iron doors groan, then scream, then snap shut decisively. You are alone now, but you must continue. How is it that the chill of the dark air can freeze your skin such that the faint warmth of the weak torch feels like a bonfire?\n\nThe walls seem to perspire, as if they share your fears. Regret is a friend who is too far away. If nothing else smolders your determination, terror will.
